Description of Key Packages:

numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For preprocessing and potential use of classical ML models.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
opencv-python: For image processing tasks.
Pillow: For image manipulation.
tensorflow & keras: For building and training the neural network model.
streamlit: For deploying the model as a web app.
3. Dataset
You'll need a dataset containing labeled images of male and female faces. Some popular datasets include:

UTKFace: A large-scale face dataset with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
CelebA: A large-scale celebrity face attributes dataset with multiple labels, including gender.
Adience: A dataset with face images labeled with gender and age groups.
Ensure the dataset is balanced and diverse to avoid biases in your model.

4. Hardware Requirements
GPU: If possible, use a GPU for faster training. Most deep learning frameworks support CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs.
Memory: At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended, especially when working with large datasets.
5. Additional Tools
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab: For interactive development and experimentation.
Anaconda: A distribution that simplifies package management and deployment.
6. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Prepare scripts for:

Data Loading: Load images and labels from the dataset.
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase data diversity.
Normalization: Normalize image pixel values.
7. Model Training and Evaluation
Develop scripts for:

Model Architecture: Define the CNN model.
Training: Train the model with the dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
8. Model Deployment (Optional)
If you plan to deploy the model, especially using Streamlit, include:

Streamlit App Script: A script to load the trained model and provide a user interface for predictions.
Model File: The trained model saved in .keras or .h5 format.
9. Documentation
Include documentation, such as a README.md file, that explains:

The project purpose.
Setup instructions.
Usage guidelines.
Model details and training process.
10. Version Control
Use Git for version control, and consider hosting your project on GitHub or a similar platform.
